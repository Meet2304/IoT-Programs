## Repository Structure

This repository is organized by topic. Each subdirectory focuses on a specific IoT concept or project and includes relevant code, explanations, and references.

## Motivation

The goal is to not just implement IoT projects, but to:
- Understand *how* different IoT components (sensors, actuators, microcontrollers, communication protocols) work together.
- Recreate and document important IoT workflows from scratch where possible.
- Build a hands-on reference for deploying IoT systems in real-world scenarios.

This is a reference for both myself and others who want a structured, practical approach to learning IoT.

## Tools and Platforms

- Arduino / ESP32
- Raspberry Pi
- Python
- C / C++
- MQTT, HTTP, CoAP
- Node-RED
- Cloud Platforms (AWS IoT, Azure IoT, Google IoT Core)
- Sensors & Actuators

## How to Use
- Clone the repository.
- Navigate to any topic or project folder to get started.
- Each section contains code, wiring diagrams (where applicable), and explanations.
- Experiment with hardware, parameters, and variations to strengthen understanding.
